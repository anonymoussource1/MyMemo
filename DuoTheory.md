# This is my Duolingo theory, and it's spicy

1. Duolingo removes discussion

2. Duolingo trains LLM on removed discussion

3. Duolingo releases AI behind paywall

4. $$$

All of this has come true. However, is the second one true?

I think so.

What do you think?

But heyyyyy, that's just a theory...
