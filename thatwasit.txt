That's it.

"It's the end of the world as we know it"

"And I feel fine"

Today, Sab 27 apr 22:22:22 (actualy it was :38 or something) was my last play at All Saints. Three Spring Musicals, Three Shakespeares, and it's all over.

This is one of the big lasts of eighth grade, fitting that it's near the end of the year.

I reached a 99 day streak on Duolingo.

I felt sick, my voice was shaking when I sung, and I loved every second.

Unfortunately I might have Covid, or maybe just a fever.

I should probably take a test.

Luckily, I get to wake up at 4:00 to get to the Big Sur International Marathon tomorrow! Woo hoo!

I get a T-Shirt!

Speaking of T-Shirts, several people commented on my dark green Trader Joe'sÂ© T-Shirt.

They said I had a late-shift!

I stayed to clean, and had a nice converstaion with Sophia. Apparently she's also volunteering at the marathon! Unless I read that wrong...

Still don't have the confidence to [REDACTED] or give the announcement about writing down Mrs. Carl quotes.

Welp I got to go soon. My dad's telling me to go to bed.

We listened to It's The End of the World as we Know it (And I feel fine), and Sweet Caroline, an homage to Sweet Olivia, which was in my first play.

Ok I really got to go now.

Bye!
