I hereby authorize myself, Mark "Daniel" Alexander Kurz, to edit this document in the occasion that may occur in which I may recollect new memories I wish to add as an addendum to this vital collection of amazingness.

First thing: Julien, being the salty snail/mollusk that he is, didn't show up at school because he had to do a "Looking forward day" at Stevenson. So I, being the Greek God that I am, PLAYED FOUR CHIMES AT ONCE, TWO IN EACH HAND, MY PRATICING WAS AMAZING, I WAS ROCKING IT, AND WHEN I FINALLY PERFORMED... it was the worst attempt of all of them.
Second thing*: Lunch time. The screw, the tiny screw, fell out of my glass, and the arm detached from the lenses. Luckily, everyone, and I mean everyone, including Ross, Brooks, and all those people, got on the floor on started looking for it. In the turf. For a tiny screw. Talk about a needle in a haystack. We didn't find it though :(.
	Second.five thing: When I got home we had a glass repair kit, and I was able to fix it (Like senora(I don't have INTL keyboard) suggested!)
Third thing: Tennis. That really got to me. Ethan. Me. Doubles partners. Tularcitos Daniel revieved. Nothing more to say.
Fourth thing: Dullest play practice I think I've ever had. Sophia talked with me, which was nice. Side note: I finally wrote the apology!!!! Now I just have to deliver it. For history's sake, we practiced the final scene of the play, which I plan to copy & paste into here sometime soon. Well I guess not copy & paste because I have to take it from a hard copy to a digital copy, but I digress. After that we practiced the carriage scene, and I had a pretty good time with that one.
Fifth thing: Our dinner tried to kill us! The oven caught on fire! Twice! Ain't that just the way. It was very delicious, though.
Sixth thing: I FOUND THE FUNNIEST VIDEO EVER. WIERD AL YANOKOVICH (I TOTALLY SPELLED THAT WRONG) SINGING NIRVANA SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT. I'VE SENT AN EMAIL TO MYSELF. HERE'S THE LINK: https://youtu.be/FklUAoZ6KxY?si=uLJDolxwWmbqYpDa
Seventh thing: have a wonderful night, me :)
	Seventh point five: and everyone else =D
LAST MINUTE EIGHT THING: I AM A GOD !!!! I GOT APRIL DUOLINGO CHALLENGE COMPLETED ON APRIL 8TH!! BEFORE NINETY EIGHT POINT FIVE PERCENT OF LEARNERS. WHO THE FRICK ARE THE OTHER ONE POINT FIVE PERCENT. GO TO HECK WITH THE LOT OF YOU. THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE. ONE GOD. ONE WORLD. ONE SINGULARITY. THERE CAN ONLY BE ME. ME. ME. ME. ME. Me. me. me .  m e .  m  e
Ninth thing: Utter perfection. Maybe I won't add anything. Maybe I've discovered enlightenment. Maybe this is all there is. Nine layers of heaven, or maybe it's seven, but now it's nine. Like the german word!
