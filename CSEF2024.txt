CSEF 2024. What a disaster. It was great =D

First of all, I was two minutes late for my first interview, but it turned out to be alright.

5 OF THE 14 JUDGES SHOWED UP. THAT'S WORSE THAN A THIRD OF THEM.

So being late was the least of my concerns.

My first judge's connection was dreadful, I could only hear every other word, sometimes the words would repeat, and he had a super thick accent.

They got better from there, but I was asked twice about whether my results were "statiscally significant," which I didn't even know was a thing until a few weeks ago.

Oh yeah. Todays Mer 17 apr 19:04:38, and SF was on Mar 16 apr 11:12 - 3:36.

4 hours 30 minutes.

Only one hour of interviews.

3 hours and thirty minutes of time I'm never getting back.

I could sue for that.



On top of all of that, their video conferencing servers went down for an hour and a half or so. Can you guess why?

THEY HAD HOMEBREWED VIDEO CONFERENCING

WHAT THE ACTUAL HECK

hopefully I do well :)

Oh yeah: For future me: Today I wrote two cards: one for Mr. Paoletti and one for Sophia. I'll probably still public this one because its funny, and no one will probably see this. Maybe this will end me? Hopefully not.
