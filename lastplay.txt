Oh boy. Here we go.

The day before my first performance of my last Spring Musical.

I'm excited, but I'm also scared. I've recorded myself singing, I wasn't too bad, and I think I've improved.

But being on stage is stressful, and I find myself unable to sing.

It's quite odd, but it being my last play seems to have put a bit more weight to this one.

Maybe this is why they always signed me up for raps, instead of actual songs. (SICK BURN)

Welp wish me luck :D

Ciao!
